#### Extreme TBD Warning

This is very much adhoc **To Be Determined** territory ... these are only five IDEAs for slightly more serious consideration  ...and a list of other brainstormed potentially implement-able approaches.

## Community Exercise and Fitness Improvement Programs for Floodplain Land

Each of these five PROPOSED approaches transforms FEMA-purchased floodplain properties from a maintenance burden into valuable community assets that enhance physical fitness, ecological function, and community connection. By respecting the natural flood cycle and avoiding permanent structures, these programs create sustainable, resilient fitness opportunities while honoring the essential role of floodplains in watershed health.

The approaches, each with **no financial expenditure or Administrative resources from the City government**, utilize nothing but vacant FEMA floodplain land and volunteer labor from those KEY VOLUNTEERS who commit [with a suggested $50/yr donation to defray administrative expense] sign up to participate physically in making these social community fitness-betterment approaches work, are as follows:

1) [Walking Trail Network](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/1-Floodplain-Walking-Trail-Network.html) ... would establish a system of natural surface walking paths throughout FEMA-purchased floodplain properties, creating an interconnected network of trails that promote regular physical activity while respecting floodplain restrictions. This approach is based on successful models from communities in Vermont, North Carolina, and Iowa that have maintained floodplain trail systems for over 25 years.

2) [Fitness Equipment Circuit](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/2-Floodplain-Fitness-Equipment-Circuit.html) ... would create a distributed network of flood-resilient fitness stations throughout FEMA-purchased properties, connected by walking paths. All elements are designed to withstand or be easily removed before flooding events. This approach is based on successful models from flood-prone communities in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and parts of Australia that have maintained flood-adaptive fitness circuits for 15+ years.

3) [Field Sports Program](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/3-Floodplain-Field-Sports-Program.html) ... utilize FEMA-purchased properties as natural playing fields for various recreational activities requiring minimal permanent infrastructure. All equipment is portable and activities are designed to adapt to seasonal changes in the floodplain. This approach is modeled after successful programs in floodplain communities in Tennessee, Virginia, and parts of the Northeast operating for 20+ years.

4) [Foraging and Natural Movement Program](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/4-Floodplain-Foraging-and-Natural-Movement-Program.html) ... creates structured opportunities for physical activity through seasonal wild edible harvesting, natural movement, and ecological stewardship on FEMA-purchased floodplain properties. This approach combines nutrition education with varied physical activities while enhancing floodplain ecological function. The model is based on successful programs in river communities in Wisconsin, Oregon, and parts of New England that have operated sustainably for 20+ years.

5) [Cultural Heritage Fitness Trail](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/5-Cultural-Heritage-Fitness-Trail.html) ...creates a fitness program by connecting physical activity with the cultural and natural history of the floodplain through an interpretive trail system with associated activities. This approach is modeled after successful programs in river communities in Kentucky, South Carolina, and parts of the Midwest operating for 25+ years.

As noted, KEY VOLUNTEERS who express commitment would be necessary; the annual suggested donation is *only suggested*, but what is necessary is a firm pledge of intention to stick with the idea and see it through.

Each of these approaches would be modeled upon something that have proven to be sustainable and successful in other communities of this size for decades. We can learn from these examples of what has worked and also avoid what has not worked.

There is no implied priority in this ordering of five. Each of the proposed approaches could be implemented individually OR multiples may be combined into ONE integrated system utilizing different sections of the floodplain for complementary activities. All five approaches emphasize volunteer leadership, minimal infrastructure, and adaptation to natural cycles, ensuring long-term sustainability with minimal ongoing costs.

## Other Community-Led Floodplain Fitness Approaches Considered As Candidates For Initiatives

Here are 100 alternative approaches, not necessrily with a lengthy history of success, for utilizing FEMA-purchased floodplain properties to enhance community fitness that fill niches in ways not directly addressed by the five primary proposals; these 100 approaches fill unique niches by focusing on more specific populations, narrower seasonal opportunities, more specialized interests, but yet might address important community betterment needs while requiring minimal infrastructure and **no financial expenditure or Administrative resources from the City government**. 

These are provokative ideas to contemplate, even though there might not be as lengthy of a record of implementation. There is nothing particularly wrong with these more narrowly-defined ideas ... they might even be a better fit for our community, as conceptual, back-of-napkin wild ideas for starting something. They are not intended to be suggested for further consideration ... but that is possible, of course.

It all comes down to the priorities of the commited volunteers who want to ensure that the ideas are implemented. Each of these ideas might be more worthy of more development OR slight tweaking before development OR actual full implementation OR possibly added to one of the primary five ideas.

Of course, EACH of these ideas would only be implemented, if there were committed volunteers committed to the specific idea AND they fight the various constraints of governments involved and were adapted to the natural flood cycle of the local floodplain.
