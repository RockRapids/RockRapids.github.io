## Design Philosophy

As best we can, we will to understand the lay of the land and look forward to what will work in 2026, by looking at what works very well now and will probably persist. 

This is probably about *reusing what has worked and will continue to be used, rather than re-inventing new. Our focus needs to be connecting, filling gaps and building something simple that future volunteers can maintain, improve, ie this is what design for maintainability and extensibility look like now.*
