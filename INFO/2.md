What follows below is a brief vision statement and Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP) development roadmap for **rockrapids.fun**

**Fun Activities, Things To See and Social Engagement**

Fun continues in Rock Rapids and builds on our Heritage

Rockrapids.fun will serve as the definitive digital guide to recreational activities, entertainment options, and special events in and around Rock Rapids, helping residents and visitors discover exciting ways to enjoy their time in the area. The platform will organize activities by category (outdoor recreation, family-friendly, dining experiences, nightlife) and by timeframe (today, this weekend, upcoming season) to help users quickly find relevant options. Integration with location data will allow visitors to plan efficient itineraries that maximize enjoyment based on proximity to Lake Okoboji or Sioux Falls attractions. Seasonal features will highlight weather-appropriate activities like winter sledding hills, summer water sports, spring hiking trails, and fall harvest festivals. The platform will showcase both recurring community events and one-time special occasions, ensuring users never miss out on fun opportunities. User-generated content including ratings, reviews, and photos will provide authentic perspectives on local experiences and help newcomers discover hidden gems.

**MVP Development Roadmap:**
1. Develop a database structure for activities with fields for location, schedule, category, and description
2. Create an intuitive calendar view with filters for activity type, age appropriateness, and indoor/outdoor
3. Implement a "happening now" feature that displays current and immediate upcoming events
4. Build a simple submission form for local businesses and organizations to add their events
5. Develop a basic recommendation engine based on user preferences and seasonal relevance
6. Launch with a core set of recurring events and special summer activities for initial content
