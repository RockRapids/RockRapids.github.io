## Minimal Viable Prototype Development Roadmap

1. **Prerequisite Research**: Before launching anything, understand the [design philosophy](#design-philosophy) and gather intelligence on already available sources of information about local recreational activities and events.

2. **Architecture Development**: Create a general knowledgebase architecture to support a simple meta-directory of activities with fields for location, schedule, category, and description, using the [technical architecture](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/29/RockRapidsApps.html#technical-architecture-1) with Remix as the primary framework.

3. **Calendar Interface**: Develop an intuitive calendar view with filters for activity type, age appropriateness, and indoor/outdoor status to simplify discovery.

4. **Real-Time Features**: Implement a "happening now" feature that displays current and immediate upcoming events for spontaneous planning.

5. **Submission System**: Build a simple submission form to assist local businesses and organizations in adding their events to the platform.

6. **Recommendation Engine**: Develop basic AI functionality for a recommendation engine based on user preferences and seasonal relevance.

7. **Initial Content**: Launch with a core set of recurring events and special seasonal activities as initial content to demonstrate the platform's value.

## Design Philosophy

As with all Rock Rapids applications, RockRapids.FUN adheres to a design philosophy focused on sustainability and practicality. This approach emphasizes:
