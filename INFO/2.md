## Minimal Viable Prototype Development Roadmap

0. Before launching anything, [understand the design philosophy](#design-philosophy)... then gather intelligence on the already available sources of information and attempt to use those data in the form of data API

1. Building on gathered intellenge, develop a general knowledgebase architecture to support a simple meta-directories of directories for activities with fields for location, schedule, category, and description, using the [technical architecture](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/29/RockRapidsApps.html#technical-architecture-1) for the Rock Rapids [community apps ecosystem](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/29/RockRapidsApps.html#executive-summary), utilizing [Remix as the primary framework](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/29/RockRapidsApps.html#why-remix-the-superior-choice-for-rock-rapids-1).

2. Create an intuitive calendar view with filters for activity type, age appropriateness, and indoor/outdoor

3. Implement a "happening now" feature that displays current and immediate upcoming events

4. Build a simple submission form to assist local businesses and organizations in add their events to different information sources comprised in the different existing directories.

5. Develop the AI for a basic recommendation engine based on user preferences and seasonal relevance

6. Launch with a core set of recurring events and special summer activities for initial content

## Design Philosophy

As best we can, we will to understand the lay of the land and look forward to what will work in 2026, by looking at what works very well now and will probably persist. 

This is probably about *reusing what has worked and will continue to be used, rather than re-inventing new. Our focus needs to be connecting, filling gaps and building something simple that future volunteers can maintain, improve, ie this is what design for maintainability and extensibility look like now.*

- [Integrate Necessary Existing and Future Datastores](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-1.html) ... We all know that digital age has *past tense* ushered in an unprecedented era of information availability, with a vast array of online resources now serving as primary repositories for community-related data ... but AI and vibe coding will change how data is exchanged. 

- [Understand Local Participation In Online Platforms](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-2.html) ... Rock Rapids, a small town in northwest Iowa, exhibits a multifaceted online presence indicative of both its rural character and the pervasive influence of digital technologies. 


- [Evaluate Local Platforms and Their Reach](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-3.html) ... Rock Rapids, Iowa, exhibits a multifaceted online presence of information served to the outside world.

- [Design For Maintainability and Extensibility](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-4.html) ... a synthesis of the best practices for designing community communication app ecosystems that are *inherently, **by design**, maintainable and easily extensible by volunteer contributors.* 

- [Think About Where the App Ecosytem Will Actually Be Built and Then Live](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-5.html) ... *Why does the choice of host for the app ecosystem matters as much as it does?* It's because **development is for building the volunteer competencies and giving volunteers satisfying ways to contribute,** but almost all of the funds needed for this project will spent on hosting for the app ecosystem AND the funding those expense often/typically [whether this is *right* or not] will come FROM the volunteer who has *bought in* and really cares about the project. *It has to be affordable.*
