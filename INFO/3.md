What follows below is a brief vision statement and Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP) development roadmap for **rockrapids.guide**

**The guide to ORDINARY information that everyone is supposed to know**

A GUIDE of service providers, school news, business updates, church bulletins, other news 

Rockrapids.guide will function as a comprehensive civic information hub that connects residents with essential community services, municipal updates, and important local announcements to enhance daily life in Rock Rapids. The platform will consolidate critical information from disparate sources—city government, utilities, schools, churches, and community organizations—into a single, easily navigable interface. Real-time alerts will notify residents about road closures, water main repairs, power outages, or other service disruptions that may impact their daily routines. An interactive community calendar will display upcoming civic events, council meetings, school activities, and religious services to help residents stay engaged with local institutions. The platform will maintain a searchable directory of local service providers, emergency contacts, and community resources for quick reference during times of need. Digital versions of community bulletins, obituaries, and official announcements will ensure important information reaches all residents regardless of their access to physical notice boards or newspapers.

**MVP Development Roadmap:**
1. Create a notification system for city service alerts and important community announcements
2. Develop a simple content management system allowing multiple organizations to post updates
3. Build a community calendar with filtering by organization type (government, church, school)
4. Implement a searchable directory of local services and emergency contacts
5. Create mobile-responsive layouts optimized for quick information access during emergencies
6. Test with a limited group of community organizations before full public launch
