**Various Artists, Different Arts, Crafts, Collection**

*Showcasing the diversity of talent in/around Rock Rapids.*

## Vision Statement Summary For This App

The rockrapids.art platform will showcase the diverse artistic talents of Rock Rapids residents, creating a vibrant digital gallery that celebrates creativity in all its formsâ€”from traditional fine arts to unique crafts like pickling and meat smoking. Local artists will gain visibility through personalized profile pages featuring their work, background stories, and contact information for commissions or purchases. The platform will foster community connections by highlighting upcoming workshops, classes, and collaborative opportunities for artists and art enthusiasts alike. Seasonal spotlights will rotate to ensure all artists receive equal exposure regardless of medium or experience level. An interactive map will guide visitors to studio locations, public art installations, and craft workshops throughout Rock Rapids. The platform will serve as both a promotional tool for local talent and an educational resource that inspires creativity in future generations of Rock Rapids artists.

## Minimal Viable Prototype Development Roadmap

0. Before launching anything, [understand the design philosophy](#design-philosophy)... then gather intelligence on the already available sources of information and attempt to use those data in the form of data API

1. Building on gathered intellenge, develop a general knowledgebase architecture to support a simple meta-directories of directories for activities with fields for name, medium, biography, contact information, and image gallery, using the [technical architecture](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/29/RockRapidsApps.html#technical-architecture-1) for the Rock Rapids [community apps ecosystem](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/29/RockRapidsApps.html#executive-summary), utilizing [Remix as the primary framework](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/29/RockRapidsApps.html#why-remix-the-superior-choice-for-rock-rapids-1).

2. Develop a simple submission form allowing artists, crafters, makers, collectors to create and update their own profiles

3. Implement a responsive grid layout to showcase artist work with filtering by medium

4. Build an events calendar integration for workshops and art-related activities

5. Create an admin dashboard for content moderation and featured artist selection

6. Test and launch a basic version with 10-15 local artist profiles as initial content

## Design Philosophy

As best we can, we will to understand the lay of the land and look forward to what will work in 2026, by looking at what works very well now and will probably persist. 

This is probably about *reusing what has worked and will continue to be used, rather than re-inventing new. Our focus needs to be connecting, filling gaps and building something simple that future volunteers can maintain, improve, ie this is what design for maintainability and extensibility look like now.*
