What follows below is a brief vision statement and Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP) development roadmap for **rockrapids.art**

**Various Artists, Different Arts, Crafts, Collection**

Showcasing the diversity of talent in/around Rock Rapids.

The rockrapids.art platform will showcase the diverse artistic talents of Rock Rapids residents, creating a vibrant digital gallery that celebrates creativity in all its formsâ€”from traditional fine arts to unique crafts like pickling and meat smoking. Local artists will gain visibility through personalized profile pages featuring their work, background stories, and contact information for commissions or purchases. The platform will foster community connections by highlighting upcoming workshops, classes, and collaborative opportunities for artists and art enthusiasts alike. Seasonal spotlights will rotate to ensure all artists receive equal exposure regardless of medium or experience level. An interactive map will guide visitors to studio locations, public art installations, and craft workshops throughout Rock Rapids. The platform will serve as both a promotional tool for local talent and an educational resource that inspires creativity in future generations of Rock Rapids artists.

**MVP Development Roadmap:**

2. Develop a simple submission form allowing artists, crafters, makers, collectors to create and update their own profiles

3. Implement a responsive grid layout to showcase artist work with filtering by medium

4. Build an events calendar integration for workshops and art-related activities

5. Create an admin dashboard for content moderation and featured artist selection
