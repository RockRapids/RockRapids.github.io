## Minimal Viable Prototype Development Roadmap

1. **Prerequisite Research**: Before launching anything, understand the [design philosophy](#design-philosophy) and gather intelligence on already available sources of information about local artists and creative events.

2. **Architecture Development**: Create a general knowledgebase architecture to support a meta-directory of artists with fields for name, medium, biography, contact information, and image gallery, using the [technical architecture](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/29/RockRapidsApps.html#technical-architecture-1) with Remix as the primary framework.

3. **Submission System**: Develop a simple submission form allowing artists, crafters, makers, and collectors to create and update their own profiles with minimal administrative oversight.

4. **Display Framework**: Implement a responsive grid layout to showcase artist work with filtering by medium, style, and location.

5. **Calendar Integration**: Build an events calendar integration for workshops and art-related activities that connects with the broader community event system.

6. **Administrative Tools**: Create an admin dashboard for content moderation and featured artist selection to maintain quality and highlight diverse talents.

7. **Launch Strategy**: Test and launch with 10-15 local artist profiles as initial content to demonstrate the platform's potential and attract additional participation.

## Design Philosophy

As with all Rock Rapids applications, RockRapids.ART adheres to a design philosophy focused on sustainability and practicality. This approach emphasizes:

- **Reusing what has worked and will continue to be used**, rather than re-inventing new solutions
- **Connecting existing systems and filling gaps** to create greater value
- **Building simple solutions that future volunteers can maintain and improve**

This philosophy is elaborated in several key strategic documents:

- [Integrate Necessary Existing and Future Datastores](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-1.html): Leveraging existing data sources while preparing for evolving technologies
- [Understand Local Participation In Online Platforms](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-2.html): Building on established digital behavior patterns
- [Evaluate Local Platforms and Their Reach](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-3.html): Understanding the existing digital landscape
- [Design For Maintainability and Extensibility](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-4.html): Creating systems that can be sustained by volunteer contributors
- [Think About Where the App Ecosystem Will Be Built and Then Live](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/03/31/RockRapidsApps-Step0-5.html): Considering the practical aspects of hosting and maintenance

## AI and Content Processing Strategy

RockRapids.ART recognizes the transformative potential of AI and content processing for enhancing the arts community. As detailed in [Jobs, Art, Economics: The Emergent Industry of Music/Content AI Data Annotation](https://rockrapids.github.io/communication/2025/04/01/RockRapidsApps-Step0-8.html), the PROCESSING of creative content represents a significant economic opportunity.

While the spotlight often shines on the power of new sophisticated AI algorithms and user-facing applications, the progress of creative AI is fundamentally tethered to the quality and depth of the data it learns from. Processing of data, such as art and music AI data annotation, is not merely a preparatory step but a critical, ongoing process that shapes the capabilities and limitations of AI in understanding, organizing, generating, and interacting with creative content.

RockRapids.ART will explore opportunities to:

- Develop local expertise in creative content annotation and processing
- Create potential remote work opportunities in AI training data preparation
- Establish Rock Rapids as an innovative community in the creative AI landscape
- Provide educational resources on the intersection of technology and creativity

This focus on processing and annotation recognizes that the ability to effectively organize, categorize, and contextualize creative content is increasingly valuable in the digital economy.
