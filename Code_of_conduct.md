# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the volunteers and contributors of the Rock Rapids community applications ecosystem, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community that reflects the values of Rock Rapids, Iowa.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Prioritizing the needs of Rock Rapids residents
* Supporting fellow volunteers in their learning and growth

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Creating technological solutions that don't align with the community's actual needs
* Prioritizing technical complexity over maintainability and accessibility

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers and community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to Mark Bruns, the project coordinator, at MarkBruns@MarkBruns.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## In-Person Collaboration

As a community-focused project with an emphasis on local volunteers, we have additional expectations for in-person interactions:

* Respect the facilities and resources where we gather
* Be punctual for in-person meetings and events
* Communicate clearly if you cannot attend a scheduled meeting
* Support new volunteers by sharing knowledge and offering mentorship
* Maintain confidentiality when accessing sensitive community information
* Be mindful of the diverse backgrounds and technical abilities of our volunteers
* Advocate for accessibility in both our digital products and physical meeting spaces
