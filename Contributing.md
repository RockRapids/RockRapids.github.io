# Contributing to Rock Rapids Community Apps

Thank you for your interest in the Rock Rapids community applications ecosystem! 

This document outlines how you can get involved and help build digital tools that serve our community.

## Who Can Contribute

The Rock Rapids applications are designed to be built and maintained by volunteers from the local community. To contribute effectively to this project, contributors should:

- Be residents of Rock Rapids, Iowa or the surrounding area
- Be able to attend occasional in-person meetings, planning sessions, and training events in Rock Rapids
- Have a genuine interest in supporting the Rock Rapids community
- Be willing to follow our project's design philosophy and technical guidelines

This local focus ensures that our applications remain deeply connected to the specific needs of Rock Rapids and can be maintained through direct, personal collaboration among contributors.

## Our Design Philosophy

Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with our core design philosophy:

1. **Reuse what works**: We prioritize established, proven solutions rather than reinventing systems unnecessarily
2. **Connect and fill gaps**: We focus on integrating existing resources and addressing unmet needs
3. **Build for maintainability**: We create simple, sustainable solutions that future volunteers can easily maintain and improve

For a deeper understanding of our approach, please review these key documents:
